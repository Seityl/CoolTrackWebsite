## The Hidden Cost of Temperature Failures in Warehouses

Temperature excursions in warehouses don't just happen during business hours. Equipment failures, power outages, and HVAC malfunctions occur at night, on weekends, and during holidays—exactly when manual checks aren't happening.

**The consequences are severe:**
- $50,000+ in spoiled inventory from a single refrigeration failure
- Failed audits and regulatory violations
- Lost customer trust and chargebacks
- Insurance claims and liability exposure
- Compromised cold chain integrity

Cool Track eliminates these risks with 24/7 automated monitoring that never sleeps.

## The Cool Track Advantage

### Installation in Minutes, Not Days

Unlike complex building automation systems, Cool Track sensors install in under 5 minutes:

1. **Unbox sensors** - Pre-configured and ready to use
2. **Place or mount** - Stick to walls or set on shelves
3. **Activate** - Sensors auto-discover and start monitoring immediately

No electricians, no IT team, no complex configuration required.

### Alerts That Actually Work

**Smart Thresholds** - Set different limits for different zones and times

**Duration-Based Alerts** - Prevent false alarms with configurable delay periods (e.g., alert after 30 minutes above max)

**Escalation** - Automatic notifications to backup contacts if primary doesn't respond

**Working Hours Configuration** - Different alert schedules for business hours vs. nights/weekends

### Peace of Mind

**24/7 Monitoring** - Continuous surveillance even when your team is off

**Power Failure Alerts** - Gateway disconnection notifications indicate power or network issues

**Battery Backup** - Sensors continue monitoring during short power outages

**Automatic Reconnection** - System resumes logging when connectivity restores

## Real-World Results

### Distribution Center - Miami, FL

**Challenge:** 200,000 sq ft frozen food warehouse with multiple refrigeration units. Manual temperature checks missed a compressor failure that cost $85,000 in spoiled inventory.

**Solution:** Deployed 24 Cool Track sensors across all zones with email and SMS alerts to facility manager and refrigeration company.

**Results:**
- Detected failing compressor at 2 AM before significant temperature rise
- Repair completed within 4 hours, zero product loss
- ROI achieved in first month from preventing single incident

### Pharmaceutical Distributor - Boston, MA

**Challenge:** FDA audit cited insufficient temperature documentation. Manual logs showed gaps during nights and weekends.

**Solution:** Implemented Cool Track with automatic CSV export for audit documentation.

**Results:**
- Passed subsequent FDA inspection with zero findings
- Eliminated 15 hours/week of manual logging
- Reduced compliance risk and improved customer confidence

### Cold Storage Facility - Seattle, WA

**Challenge:** Managing 12 separate cold rooms with different temperature requirements. Needed unified monitoring across all zones.

**Solution:** Multi-gateway deployment with zone-specific threshold configurations and customized alert contacts.

**Results:**
- Single dashboard view of entire facility
- Reduced response time from hours to minutes
- Prevented estimated $200K+ in losses in first year

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How many sensors do I need for my warehouse?**

Typically 1-2 sensors per refrigeration/freezer unit, plus sensors for loading docks, staging areas, and critical storage zones. We provide a free facility assessment to recommend optimal coverage.

**What's the range of the sensors?**

Sensors communicate with gateways up to 300 feet (line of sight). For large warehouses, we deploy multiple gateways to ensure complete coverage.

**Can Cool Track monitor refrigerated trucks?**

Yes. GPS-enabled sensors track temperature during transport. They log data offline if connectivity is lost, then upload when connection resumes.

**How long do sensor batteries last?**

3-5 years depending on reporting frequency. Low battery alerts notify you well in advance of replacement needs.

**Is Cool Track compatible with our existing WMS?**

Yes. Our REST API integrates with most WMS, ERP, and facility management systems. We also provide direct data export options.

**What happens during a power outage?**

Sensors continue logging on battery backup. The system automatically reconnects when power returns and syncs all missed data.

**Do we need IT support to install Cool Track?**

No. Sensors are plug-and-play with automatic discovery. Basic internet connectivity is all that's required. Our support team assists with initial setup.

**Can we try Cool Track before committing?**

Yes. Contact us to discuss evaluation options for your facility.
